# Image Manipulation
A fun project to get people started with Bash scripting.

## Goal
The goal is to scale a given image to the specified dimensions. You must first determine if that image is in portrait or landscape so that you do not distort the picture. This exercise forces you to:

* start seeing everything as text
* break the problem down into smaller issues
* translate that logic into a script
